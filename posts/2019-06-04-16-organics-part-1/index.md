Welcome to the first episode of our Organics series! Organic agriculture is such a big topic we had to take four episodes to talk about it. This week, Hallie and Chris are focusing on what exactly organic agriculture is and where it came from. We learn about organics around the world, what it takes to become organic, and a really cool lady who really loved soil.
