**Hallie:** Hello and welcome to One to Grow On. A show where we dig into questions about agriculture and try to understand how food production impacts us and our world. My name is Hallie Casey and I studied and currently work in agriculture.  
  
**Chris:** I’m Chris Casey, Hallie’s dad. Each episode we pick an area of agriculture or food production to discuss and this week it’s bananas.  
  
**\[Background music\].  
**  
**Hallie:** Bananas, that is what we are discussing.  
  
**Chris:** Bananas, the fruit.  
  
**Hallie:** What do you know about bananas, dad?  
  
**Chris:** I know that bananas are a berry.  
  
**Hallie:** Do you know that? How?  
  
**Chris:** You have said so on multiple occasions over the course of this podcast.  
  
**Hallie:** \[Laughs\]. Great work to you and me.  
  
**Chris:** Especially when we were asked, what is a berry? Or rather, what is berry?  
  
**Hallie:** Yeah, banana is berry.  
  
**Chris:** I also have been reading a book about bananas, but I haven’t gotten very far. I know there was something about some rich guy forcing people to go into the jungle and build a railroad or something. I don’t know.  
  
**Hallie:** Yeah, we’ll get to that.  
  
**Chris:** Great. I’m sure it’s great. Oh, and there’s a place in Belgium where they sort of keep all of the different varieties of bananas. That’s like banana central.  
  
**Hallie:** Oh, I don’t have that covered in this episode.  
  
**Chris:** Okay. Well, great. I know something that you don’t.  
  
**Hallie:** Maybe I can put that in the extra research.  
  
**Chris:** Maybe, but that’s all I know about it really. I don’t remember exactly where it is or what it’s called, but I think it’s like the center for banana researcher, something. I remember you saying that all bananas are clones. At least all the ones we eat. All the Cavendish bananas.  
  
**Hallie:** You know the word Cavendish. That’s something you know about bananas.  
  
**Chris:** I do. I got that from the book.  
  
**Hallie:** Nice.  
  
**Chris:** I guess there are still other bananas, but I mean, they’re all going to die because of some blight anyway, so enjoy them while you can.  
  
**Hallie:** \[Laughs\]. Yeah, good summary. We’re going to get further into all of those things. Let’s start at the very beginning. The banana, the Latin name is Musa and the family name is Musaceae. The family is named after the banana because it’s like the star of the family.  
  
**Chris:** Wait, how is that named after the banana?  
  
**Hallie:** The family is Musaceae and the bananas name is Musa. So, Musaceae.  
  
**Chris:** I see. Okay. Got it.  
  
**Hallie:** As you mentioned, the banana is a berry. The banana is also the largest herbaceous flowering plant. Herbaceous meaning never develops woody tissue and flowering meaning it has flowers. Typically, they get around 16 feet, but they can get up to 20 to 25 feet tall, so they’re a pretty big plant.  
  
**Chris:** If it’s a berry, then why do people make cream pie out of it instead of a berry pie out of it?  
  
**Hallie:** Because you add cream as opposed to a berry pie where you just add sugar.  
  
**Chris:** I mean, I think a banana pie with sugar and a little pectin might turn out pretty well. What do you think?  
  
**Hallie:** Well, you don’t put pectin in a berry pie. You just put sugar.  
  
**Chris:** Oh, I thought you put pectin in it to make it all gloopy.  
  
**Hallie:** I have never done that. I’ve only ever just added sugar to strawberries and then you just dump it in a pie shell and you cook it.  
  
**Chris:** Or maybe some tapioca.  
  
**Hallie:** I have put tapioca in sometimes, but it’s not necessary. I’ve definitely done it sometimes where it’s just sugar and berries and strawberries and blueberries and stuff.  
  
**Chris:** All right. Well, I derail this into wanting to eat pie. So, you were saying.  
  
**Hallie:** That’s the basics of the banana, but what actually is the banana?

The "root" of the banana is actually a corm, which is not root tissue, but stem tissue. We’ve talked about corms in the past. It’s modified stem tissue and then the banana "trunk" is not actually a trunk because trunks are woody. As we mentioned already, it’s an herbaceous plant. Never develops woody tissue. The "trunk of the banana tree" is actually what’s called the pseudostem. Pseudostem just means not actually a stem, but looks like a stem and it’s actually made of really tightly compacted leaf tissue.  
  
**Chris:** Weird. It’s like one big green thing.  
  
**Hallie:** Well, most plants are, dad.  
  
**Chris:** But trees are brown in parts of them and I guess, would you call it like a stock? Would it be like a stock?  
  
**Hallie:** Yeah, stock is totally a fine word, but usually people say trunk just because it’s so big. They’re used to saying trunk for a big thing like that.  
  
**Chris:** Got it.  
  
**Hallie:** Whereas usually I think of stock as like a flower stock or something, but it is in fact more of like a stock.  
  
**Chris:** But you wouldn’t chop it down and pop it on the fireplace.  
  
**Hallie:** Absolutely not. It would not go well. The corm itself is a perennial tissue, but the rest of the banana is usually not perennial. When a banana is mature, when it’s an adult banana, usually the corm, the stem tissue under the ground will send up an actual stem, like an actual legitimate stem as well as an inflorescence, meaning a head of flowers. This is also called the banana heart. In the industry, they call it the banana heart, which is lovely. Then usually the above ground structure will die it back, like the whole pseudostem and the leaves and everything. Once you have bananas, you harvest the bananas, the above ground stuff ties back and then you get new growth from that perennial corm that’s under the ground.  
  
**Chris:** Cool. Sorry, I’m trying to track. I keep rolling with the word corm around in my head because it’s not corn. It’s corm and so I’m trying to make sure that sticks like a big old stock, but when it’s mature, it pops up the stem, it grows the heart and then when that’s done, you get the banana. Banana comes right off. Does it grow another stem?  
  
**Hallie:** Yeah, once you pop the bananas off, then the above ground stuff is done for the year. It just like skedaddles and dies back to the ground. Then starting the next year, when it’s time for a new banana to grow, it just starts from the ground up, gets like that 16 feet tall and then once it’s nice and tall, you get a new inflorescence that pops up and new banana and year after year, that’s how it goes.  
  
**Chris:** That is wild. I want to try to find a time lapse of this happening in a field of banana trees. Are they called trees? I don’t know.  
  
**Hallie:** They are colloquially called trees. They’re not trees, but they’re called a banana tree.  
  
**Chris:** Just seeing them grow 16 feet every year, that’s wild.  
  
**Hallie:** Yeah, they’re pretty cool plants. How many bananas are there? There are more than 1000 varieties of bananas in the world that are produced for consumption locally. However, as you mentioned, we really only eat the Cavendish banana. That’s the name of the variety, the Cavendish.  
  
**Chris:** Are there other varieties just eaten by other people just not by us in other areas of the world? Is that what it is?  
  
**Hallie:** It’s a lot of like, this is the banana I have next to my house, so this is the banana that I eat. It’s just varieties that are native to different parts of the world and that’s what is locally grown, but it’s not to any commercial production.  
  
**Chris:** Okay.  
  
**Hallie:** I want you to guess how many Cavendish bananas specifically just Cavendish bananas not the rest of the other 999 varieties, just the Cavendish bananas are grown? For a baseline, we got about 76 million metric tons of apples in 2019 and in oranges, it was about 46.1 million metric tons. If that’s apples and oranges, where do you think bananas falls?  
  
**Chris:** I’m going to say 1 billion tons.  
  
**Hallie:** Why would you go that far?  
  
**Chris:** Because it sounds funnier than just trying to be accurate. I don’t know. We’ll say 200 million tons.  
  
**Hallie:** 200 million tons when I gave you 76,000,000 and 46,000,000. 
  
**Chris:** Well, you said 1 billion was like way too high.  
  
**Hallie:** Yeah, it’s 200 million. Now you’re really like letting me down. I thought it was a high number and you’re like shooting above it. It’s 127.3 million. A lot more than apples and oranges.  
  
**Chris:** Well, it is a lot more. It’s still within an order of magnitude-ish. Maybe not, but yeah that’s a lot. That’s okay. More than double oranges. One and a half times about apples, so bananas are like super popular.  
  
**Hallie:** They’re very popular. As of 2015, bananas were the second most produced fruit by quantity not by weight after watermelons.  
  
**Chris:** Jeez Louise.  
  
**Hallie:** What is a banana? A banana by any other name would taste as sweet. No, it wouldn’t. I want to talk about the difference between plantains and bananas. What do you know about plantains, dad?  
  
**Chris:** There’s a restaurant not too far from my house that sells fried plantains and they look a lot like short bananas and they’re delicious.  
  
**Hallie:** Is that all you got?  
  
**Chris:** That’s all I got.  
  
**Hallie:** Okay. Pretty good. A lot of scientists, a lot of banana breeders, marketers argue about what a plantain versus what a banana is. They’re extremely closely related. For our purposes, plantains are much starchier. Plantains are usually cooked, whereas bananas are usually eaten raw. The term is also often bandied about the dessert banana. That’s what we’re talking about. The banana is sweet. It’s a treat. It’s not part of your meal whereas plantains can be.  
  
**Chris:** It goes well in cereal and ice cream.  
  
**Hallie:** For sure. In terms of nutritional value, the bananas are generally less healthier for you than a plantain, but they’re still okay. They have like one fifth of your daily nutritional value for vitamin B6. They have 17% of your daily nutritional value for vitamin C.

They have some potassium in them. They’re fine. They’re decent. They’re an okay little fruit, but plantains are much healthier. They have 54% of your daily nutritional value for vitamin C. They have 25% of your daily nutritional value for vitamin B6. They’ve got a whole bunch of good stuff in them and they are healthier, but less sweet. Less desserty.  
  
**Chris:** Okay. But I mean, if you have some fried plantains, they taste pretty sweet people. I got to tell you.  
  
**Hallie:** They’re a great food. If you can get your hands on them and you’ve never tried them before, would highly recommend.  
  
**Chris:** I mean, if I had some right now, I would eat them and take a break.  
  
**Hallie:** Shall we do that? Shall we go take a break?  
  
**Chris:** Yes, there is some time between March which we recorded this particular episode in this particular mid roll. In that stretch of time, I had some fried plantains and they were so good. I love them. They’re the best Peruvian roast chicken side that I’ve ever had. That’s for sure.  
  
**Hallie:** This episode we actually wanted to encourage all of our listeners, particularly those who are US citizens to register to vote. The deadline to register here in Texas is coming up in October, but you can go to youtube.com/howtovoteineverystate to learn more about how to register where you are.  
  
**Chris:** We are lucky, even though it doesn’t always feel that way to live somewhere where we do have a voice in our representation and so please, let’s use it. Register to vote and then vote. You know who I’m sure votes?  
  
**Hallie:** Who is that?  
  
**Chris:** Our patrons, especially our starfruit patrons, Vikram, Lindsay, Mama Casey, Patrick, and Shianne.  
  
**Hallie:** You guys are so incredible. You keep our world spinning and we are so so grateful for you.  
  
**Chris:** It’s true. But now, back to the episode.  
  
**Hallie:** Dad, do you have a nature fact for us?  
  
**Chris:** I do. Like in many other cities, there’s a marathon in Barcelona and the fastest marathon ever run by a competitor dressed as a fruit was two hours, 58 minutes and 20 seconds recorded at the Barcelona marathon on March 6th, 2011. His name was Patrick Whiteman from the UK and he was dressed as a banana.  
  
**Hallie:** God bless Patrick Whiteman.  
  
**Chris:** Right.  
  
**Hallie:** Doing some great work in Barcelona.  
  
**Chris:** Yeah, I looked up a picture of him and it looks like one of those big felts banana costumes and I can’t imagine running 26 miles anyway, but 26 miles in a big old banana costume and you’re already hot and sweaty as it is. Man, that thing had to be rank.  
  
**Hallie:** Yeah, that’s commitment to breaking a record, but I admire it.  
  
**Chris:** It’s true. Yes.  
  
**Hallie:** Great nature fact, dad.  
  
**Chris:** Thank you. Oh, you got to do the jingle.  
  
**Hallie:** I was about two. I was just giving you a compliment.  
  
**Chris:** All right. Well, thank you. I appreciate that. It’s important to be supportive like that.  
  
**Hallie:** Tara tarara. Nature fact. Okay. Let’s talk about the history of the banana. When I was researching this, I found a lot of conflicting origin stories.

The banana has been around for a really long time and it’s kind of unclear where it originated thousands of years ago.  
  
**Chris:** Real quick, when we say originated, obviously it’s a plant that has existed, but the banana in its current form was bred by people to have these characteristics.  
  
**Hallie:** Right. The broader banana plants, not specifically the Cavendish. The broader banana plant, how did that evolve?  
  
**Chris:** Got it.  
  
**Hallie:** Where did that come from? Where’s that native to? I couldn’t find a lot. I couldn’t find like a specific origin story. I found a paper in the journal of Ethnobotany Research and Applications that said that the reason for this was because it is vegetatively propagated and they talked about like sweet potatoes as another example of this. The banana isn’t leaving a lot of pollen and they are also herbaceous, so they’re not leaving like wood or seeds or nuts for us to look back in the history of soil of a region. Maybe have a fossil record to really see where is this thing evolving. That might be one of the reasons why we don’t have a very specific origin story for the banana plant evolution.  
  
**Chris:** The tissue is too soft to stick around for too long.  
  
  

**Hallie:** That same paper estimated that 87% of banana production globally is for local food consumption, which was citing an article from Biodiversity International. I couldn’t find that article from Biodiversity International, but I think that the point is still totally valid, whether or not that 87% number is still accurate today. It’s a really key crop for subsistence farmers. I’m going to go on and talk about the history of large scale production of bananas, but bananas and plantains specifically these species is really important for subsistence farmers around the world in a lot of the global south. A really important thing to just remember as we go on to talk about the large scale production of banana plants.  
  
**Chris:** Are you going to talk about why or is it just important to them because it’s such either A, an important cash crop or B, it’s an actual source of nutrition for them?  
  
**Hallie:** Yeah, that’s a really good question. It’s mostly the latter. It’s quite common to have banana plants nearby a house, but not necessarily in a big field. Bananas are a really difficult crop to market, which we’re going to talk about. They’re quite fragile as opposed to something like yams or rice or a lot of other larger scale crops that you see subsistence farmers being able to market beyond just home consumption. Bananas are not easy in that same way. You need a lot of cold storage. You need a lot of packaging and you really need a developed supply chain, but they are quite nutritious, particularly like the heartier plantain plants are really nutritious and they’re pretty easy to grow most places in the global south. They have been in a lot of the global south for a really long time. They’ve been in South America and Latin America. They’ve been in Africa and they’ve been in Southern Asia for a long time, so it’s something that’s common in cultural recipes. It’s often just like nearby the house.

You’re able to mash it up or include it in some dish, but it’s mostly for home consumption.  
  
**Chris:** Got it.  
  
**Hallie:** Let’s talk about the history of bananas in not the global south, in Europe and the US. Up until we had wider spread refrigeration, it was just pretty much a luxury food in the US and Europe and this is true for a lot of these perishable crops. If you couldn’t get them on a ship across the ocean, then only the Richie Rich’s could really afford to get them.  
  
**Chris:** Okay.  
  
**Hallie:** Around the turn of the century, you had two companies, Standard Fruit and United Fruit that took over large swaths of land in Central and South America and very quickly ramped up production and built demand in the US. They were really building demand once that refrigeration technology existed really introducing this fruit that nobody had any idea what it was, how to eat it and really making that demand from basically nothing. This is where that story you were talking about the guy with the railroad track came in. There was this guy Minor C Keith, he ended up being the CEO of United Fruit, which is one of these two large companies and he was from Brooklyn, moved down to Costa Rica to help out with his uncle’s railroad project, ended up planting a lot of bananas or having his workers plant, I should say bananas while he was doing this railroad project and found out that the railroad he was building was not terribly profitable.

But was building this demand to be able to sell these bananas back in the US and now he had this newly built railroad for extremely cheap and was basically exploiting the Costa Rican government to control large areas of land around his railroad. It became really easy for him to continue to exploit the workers he was already employing to build that railroad. Once the railroad was built to produce a lot of bananas and then he had this really cheap railroad that was already built, getting them back up to the US. I got really down a rabbit hole with a lot of this history. It’s very intense and I don’t think I have time to go super in-depth with all of the stories and all of the histories on this. I’m going to put more info on the Patreon under the extra research. If you want to learn more, you can go there. But I do think it’s important to talk about this history. Bananas got very cheap in the US and to this day, they’re a pretty cheap fruit. That means that production costs are really, really cheap, right? If you have a cheap fruit, then you have to have cheaper production costs. The way that these companies Standard Fruit and United Fruit achieved this is they had a very tight control on these foreign governments and the land within them. It basically became what I saw described as like a neo feudal system where a handful of very powerful companies, exploited Central American countries and Central American laborers and also benefited from government grants and tax breaks while all the time denying their Central American workforce, a living wage or basic rights. This is where the term banana republic comes from. These companies were granted huge amounts of land in Central America. Some of it was "bought", but a lot of it was not and these land grants were tax breaks or government grants in exchange for building privately owned infrastructure like roads that was meant to benefit the very communities that they were actually exploiting. Eventually, there became a lot of organized labor protests around these poor working conditions.

Companies used extreme force using either private militia forces that the national military of those countries or in some specific cases, actual US forces under the guise of combating communism to fight these labor protests and basically punish, kill, assault the labor forces that were striking and the people that were striking and protesting in solidarity with them. There’s a lot more information about the history of US involvement in Central America under the guise of anticommunist propaganda that looking with a historical view seems extremely, extremely linked to United Fruit and Standard Fruits interests. I saw this really good quote from Dan Koppel. It was an interview with Dan Koppel.  
  
**Chris:** That’s the guy that wrote the book I’m reading.  
  
**Hallie:** Exactly. Yeah, he wrote the book Banana: The Fate of the Fruit That Changed the World. In this interview he said, "The banana is an impossible export fruit. It’s fragile. It ripens quickly. It gets rotten fast and the way to do it is to make it so cheap that your money is made on volume." They were trying to just produce as many bananas as possible at a cheaper cost as possible in order to get any return back and they got millions and millions of dollars in profits, but that was all made at the cost of these people’s lives and their dignity and their human rights.  
  
**Chris:** I assume we’re going to get to sort of the current state of the banana. Okay. Then I’ll hold my questions until we get to that point.  
  
**Hallie:** I know that was like a big dump. I told you I really went into research.

This took me like three times as long as it usually takes me to research an episode about this because I really wanted to do it justice while also trying to keep it within the scope of the episode and the time that we have here today.  
  
**Chris:** Sure.  
  
**Hallie:** In the 1900s, the US ended up bringing multiple antitrust lawsuits against Standard Fruit and United Fruit company, so we did end up seeing changes both from those lawsuits, that litigation, as well as from the labor movement from Central America. Eventually, I think it was closer to the fifties and sixties. I might have my dates wrong there, but the companies ended up changing their names and Standard Fruit became Dole and United Fruit became Chiquita. Today in the 2010s, this is 2013 numbers. Five companies own 44% of the banana industry down from 70% in 2002. A lot of this was because of the movement that was started really in the eighties for multinational companies to divest landholdings in Central America for bananas and replace company production with independently produced bananas.  
  
**Chris:** So larger companies are instead of producing the bananas themselves, they’re buying from local people who produce the bananas.  
  
**Hallie:** Right.  
  
**Chris:** Okay. That was kind of, I guess, leading into my questions as the banana is still, like you said, very, very cheap. Therefore, methods of production must still be very, very cheap.

Have labor conditions and such things improved?  
  
**Hallie:** One of the tricky things about having more independent production, which don’t get me wrong is a good thing. You do also have a harder time having generalized statements, right? Because it’s not five companies that are producing all of the world’s bananas. Yes, largely speaking, there are improvements in labor conditions that is not universally true across the board. A lot of the changes we’ve seen are in like technological changes, particularly in post-harvest technology. It’s easier to transport bananas without them going bad as fast. Here’s the thing. We have talked about the Cavendish banana. The bananas that we were just talking about in the last segment about the 1900s was not the Cavendish banana.  
  
**Chris:** Right.  
  
**Hallie:** What?  
  
**Chris:** I knew that, sorry.  
  
**Hallie:** Oh, you did.  
  
**\[Laughter\].**  
  
**Chris:** I’m not shocked. Yeah, I think I got this from the book.

There’s sort of speculation on what are grandparents and great grandparents tasted when they tasted a banana at the turn of the century and in the early 1900s.  
  
**Hallie:** Right. The banana that was grown in the first half of the 1900s was the Gros Michel. This was very similar to the Cavendish in a lot of ways. It was seedless. It grew via clones. However, in 1903, a strain of fusarium wilt called Panama disease first appeared and started taking out these Gros Michel plants like crazy.  
  
**Chris:** That’s what? A fungus?  
  
**Hallie:** It’s like a fungus. It is indeed like a fungus. It’s not just like a fungus. It is a fungus. By 1960, the Gros Michel was commercially extinct. Like you said, we don’t really know. There’s not a lot of people who tasted this plant because by the 1940s, it was very hard to find. It was much less common to see bananas and it wasn’t really until like onto the seventies, when we started to see bananas becoming more common. There was not really a lot of comparisons ever. You didn’t ever have the Gros Michel and the Cavendish in the same room at the same time where you could say, here are the differences between these two bananas. There’s a lot of speculation on what is different between these two bananas. The companies, particularly Dole, once it started to see Panama disease pop up and become an issue, started investing a lot of time in searching around for commercially viable bananas. The thing about bananas is that because for thousands of years, people have been selecting against seeds in bananas, right? Nobody wants seeds and bananas, even us and nobody has for thousands of years. It’s actually really difficult to get a seeded banana and that means it’s really difficult to breed bananas.

Basically, what these companies were doing was just traversing the globe and examining all the bananas and trying to categorize them and see if they were marketable, if they were tasty, if they were easy to ship, if they had that lovely, long yellow look of what we expect now from a banana, and if they were resistant to Panama disease. Eventually, they found the Cavendish.  
  
**Chris:** Wow. I thought the sort of long, vague, skinny brown bits in the middle were banana seeds only just couldn’t really tell that they were seeds because they were squishy like the rest of the fruit, did someone lie to me? Were they wrong? Have all the bananas that I’ve been eating been seedless?  
  
**Hallie:** Yeah, bananas are essentially seedless. None of those seeds that we actually eat in the bananas are viable ever.  
  
**Chris:** I see.  
  
**Hallie:** Those are basically the relics of what were once seeds and the great, great grandfather of a banana.  
  
**Chris:** Okay. Wow.  
  
**Hallie:** Once upon a time, the banana had a seed and now these itsy bitsy little tiny seeds are what we have. It’s the same thing like if you eat a seedless grape, and there’s like those little tiny guys in there, they’re not hard and crunchy and they’re really, really small.

You can’t plant a great plant with it, but it’s what the seeds once were.  
  
**Chris:** You can’t plant a banana tree with the banana.  
  
**Hallie:** Yeah, they’re all clones. They’re all vegetatively produced.  
  
**Chris:** Got it.  
  
**Hallie:** That’s been the case for thousands of years, so it’s hard to breed bananas because how we breed plants is we cross-pollinate and cross-pollinate and cross-pollinate and eventually something new pops out. We can’t do that with bananas. Eventually, they found the Cavendish. It was more fragile than Gros Michel actually. There are videos of people having big bunches of Gros Michel bananas and just throwing them onto a ship. We can’t do that with the Cavendish. You got to put it in a box, you got to put the box on the ship. Otherwise, they get all bruised and brown and consumers are not so interested, but for a long time it was good. Life was good. We had a banana that we liked and everything was looking up for these banana companies.  
  
**Chris:** For a long time you say.  
  
**Hallie:** For a long time until the 1980s. So really for like 20-ish years.  
  
**Chris:** I feel like there were so many good things that changed for the worse in the 1980s, but that’s a whole other podcast.  
  
**Hallie:** \[Laughs\]. In the 1980s, Panama disease reappeared. It was very similar to the first Panama disease, but it was a different strand kind of like different strands of flu viruses.  
  
**Chris:** Okay.  
  
**Hallie:** This second fungus strand, the second disease strand arrived and started to affect Cavendish bananas.  
  
**Chris:** The bananas got their own pandemic.  
  
**Hallie:** Pretty much. Not to be a downer. I told you guys we wouldn’t talk anymore about the P word or the C word.  
  
**Chris:** Oh, sorry.  
  
**Hallie:** \[Laughs\]. Yeah, basically. We saw a lot of bananas being wiped out in Southern Asia that were Cavendish bananas. We don’t have it yet in the Americas. It hasn’t gotten here yet. Just by luck of the draw.  
  
**Chris:** I read the only place in the US that bananas were grown was Hawaii.  
  
**Hallie:** No, I mean the Americas, not just the USA, Central America and Columbia.  
  
**Chris:** There is my ethnocentrism coming out right there, but okay. The whole Western hemisphere basically.  
  
**Hallie:** The fungus will arrive at some point. If the world has learned anything about epidemiology in the last six months, it’s not a matter of if. It’s a matter of when. One day the Panama disease will reach Central America and it will basically wipe out every last Cavendish banana, and it will happen very quickly.  
  
**Chris:** Okay. What do we do then? We just don’t have any more banana splits.  
  
**Hallie:** I saw this good quote in an interview with Alan Brown Ballana, I think is how you say his last name. He’s a biologist with the Institute of Tropical Agriculture. He said they dodged a bullet in the 1950s by identifying Cavendish. I think if there was something out there they would have found it by now. These companies didn’t stop looking. When they found Cavendish, they were like, just in case we better find something else. Or like, what if we find something else that’s easier to grow or like sweeter and easier to sell?  
  
**Chris:** But they just haven’t found it yet.  
  
**Hallie:** They haven’t found it yet. Which means it probably doesn’t exist. Also, if they did find something, the banana supply chain is built custom for the Cavendish. Every single banana is genetically identical, meaning it’s almost identical. They look almost exactly the same.

The only thing that changes between bananas is where they’re grown, how they’re grown, what the temperature is. Bananas are the same size. Bananas are the same shape. Bananas need exactly the same temperature, the exact same gas mixture. The whole supply chain is built specifically for the Cavendish. Even if they did find another banana, it would not be easy to just like whoop, okay, we’ll just add this banana into our whole process. We would have to completely restructure the supply chain, so that would be a huge lift. Like we talked about earlier, resistance can’t really be bred, right? Because we’ve got no seeds to breed. There is one hope and it is a GMO banana.  
  
**Chris:** Oh boy.  
  
**Hallie:** There are some GMO bananas. There is still work being done on a GMO banana because we are just waiting for the rest of the Cavendish bananas to go extinct. Not the banana plant to be clear. The banana as a species will on, but the Cavendish banana, which is marketable will die off at some point. It could happen tomorrow. We don’t know when it will happen. So there is work being done on a GMO banana, but at some point in the future, there will be no banana for you to buy at the grocery store other than a GMO banana.  
  
**Chris:** The banana, as we know it is I guess basically doomed. It’s just a matter of time, so enjoy him while you can. If you want viable, healthy crops for a very long time, don’t base your entire economic structure on clones.  
  
**Hallie:** Last quote. It’s a three quote episode. This quote from Randy Plots, who’s a professor of plant pathology at the University of Florida.

I don’t know if he meant for it to be a little poem, but when he said it, it rhymed and I love it. His little poem quote was once the pathogen is established, that’s all she wrote for Cavendish.  
  
**Chris:** Also, there’s a guy named Ballana that studies the banana.  
  
**Hallie:** \[Laughs\].
