[Listen to the full episode.](https://www.onetogrowonpod.com/40-houseplants/)

**Hallie:** Hello and welcome to One to Grow On. A show where we dig into questions about agriculture and try to understand how food production impacts us and our world. My name is Hallie Casey and I studied and currently work in agriculture.  
  
**Chris:** I'm Chris Casey, Hallie's dad. Each episode we pick an area of agriculture or food production to discuss and this week we are talking about houseplants.  
  
**\[Background music\].  
**  
**Hallie:** What do you know about the humble houseplant, dad?  
  
**Chris:** Why would anyone want to live inside of a plant?  
  
**Hallie:** Oh brother.  
  
**Chris:** As their house?  
  
**Hallie:** Oh God.  
  
**Chris:** Their house.  
  
**Hallie:** Oh no. \[Laughs\].  
  
**Chris:** I know that they are plants that you can put inside of your house. I suppose they're usually in some sort of receptacle like a pot. You have to occasionally water them. That's what I know.  
  
**Hallie:** Pretty good.  
  
**Chris:** Oh, really? Show over. We're done?  
  
**Hallie:** That's the whole show. That's all we wanted to say.  
  
**Chris:** Okay.  
  
**Hallie:** No, not really.  
  
**Chris:** All right.  
  
**Hallie:** When talking about the beginning of the houseplant, which is where I want to start this episode, a lot of people talk about the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, ancient China, ancient Egypt. They had plants and they were inside. People have had plants on the inside for a long time, but it didn't really become trendy in modern times until really Victorian England when it kind of became a fixture of the middle class household at least here in the West.  
  
  

**Chris:** Wow. I thought you were going to say something like the original cavemen had likened on their walls.  
  
**Hallie:** I mean, they did. That's true.  
  
**Chris:** All right.  
  
**Hallie:** One of the most famous old school houseplants from this Victorian period is cast iron plants. There's actually a really good episode of the houseplant podcast On The Ledge with Jane Perrone. It's episode 138 and they only talk about cast iron plants and it's extremely fascinating.  
  
**Chris:** Okay. What in the world is a cast iron plant? Is that a plant that you put in cast iron or grow on cast iron or is made of cast iron? I don't know.  
  
**Hallie:** It is none of those things. It's also called an Aspidistra. They're called cast iron plants because they're tough. They're really tough like cast iron would be.  
  
**Chris:** They're tough to eat or tough to kill?  
  
**Hallie:** Tough to kill, yeah. They're sturdy. That's how they got the name. They're just super sturdy, but Aspidistra is just the nicer name. Cast iron plant now has a bad connotation because it's like an old school plant. It's like passé, but if you say Aspidistra oh, that sounds so nice. But cast iron plant is old school.  
  
**Chris:** All right. Cool.  
  
**Hallie:** But this episode of On The Ledge, which also can I say is a very great name for a podcast about houseplants is terrific. You should check it out.  
  
**Chris:** Do people put houseplants on ledges?  
  
**Hallie:** Yeah, like on the ledge of a window, counter.  
  
**Chris:** Okay. I like that. That's great. I love that name.  
  
**Hallie:** In 1960s, houseplants really got kicked up in terms of a design feature. Before that it was mostly just, oh yes a nice plant and they're good for me, question mark. But in the 1960s, it was really considered a part of the design as we moved into this mid-century modern era of interior design. Houseplants and particularly different tropical plants really became big features of rooms. This kind of diminished as you moved into the 1980s. Particularly for like houses, it became more popular to have like a fake plant. But in the Moli’i Gardens, actually I was doing research for this episode and particularly like the Moli’i Garden was something that was called out as the first public space that had a larger planting more than just like a pot. You remember here in Austin at the Barton Creek Mall, there's a big garden over by one of the fountains. That's pretty common. That large indoor planting was the first time we really saw it in the 1980s in malls.  
  
**Chris:** I got to be honest with you. I noticed the fountains but I don't know that I noticed the plants maybe like some big leaves or something. I never really thought about that. Interesting. A garden inside of a mall, not just an outdoor shopping mall, but an indoor shopping mall.  
  
**Hallie:** What a concept.  
  
**Chris:** Okay. Is it like a big greenhouse with this sky roof, sun roof, translucent roof?  
  
**Hallie:** I mean, it's just on the ground floor, you got a fountain and you got plants around the fountain.  
  
**Chris:** I guess the fluorescent lights are enough for them.  
  
**Hallie:** A lot of malls also have skylights and stuff like that. Indoor plants really don't need a lot of lights, so it works. Today, a lot of houseplants are popular, particularly because a lot of people are renting and it's really easy to fill your house with houseplants as a way to make it feel homey, but without having to make any permanent changes to the structure, like painting or wallpapering or putting up shelves or something like that. They're just super on trend now, so I want to talk about them.  
  
**Chris:** It sounds like they sort of became popular in Victoria England and then all of a sudden few decades later it was akin to picking out furniture. You also had to pick out some houseplants.  
  
**Hallie:** Right. A lot of reasons for that is mostly around the advancement of the industry and the advancement of the greenhouse technology. It's become much easier to find those tropical plants that maybe we just couldn't find them in the 1920s, 1930s because we didn't have ways to transport them and carry them and that industry really hadn't developed. Whereas now you can find them at every single supermarket at every single hardware store. They're just super common because our industry has really developed and we have ways to transport them and care for them and all of that.  
  
**Chris:** Is it true they do better if you play music for them?  
  
**Hallie:** I don't know. Maybe we could do a whole episode on playing music for your plants.  
  
**Chris:** Okay. That'd be cool.  
  
**Hallie:** What are the reasons that we keep houseplants? Number one, we've been talking about it. It adds to the aesthetic nature of a space. For sure, I found a lovely Architectural Digest article that particularly talked about Funkshway, which of course is an ancient Chinese method of creating a balanced energy in a space. They offered some suggestions of different things that you might want to do in your house, both in terms of design and in terms of more utilitarian things. For example, if you wanted to give your space a sense of grounding or softness, they recommended philodendron or jade. If you wanted to heighten the space, they recommended ficus or rubber plant or a banana leaf plant, all of which are quite tall.

If you wanted to balance excess water, kind of a more utilitarian need, like somewhere in a bathroom or a laundry room, they recommended the lincon air plant, or perhaps pothos, which you're familiar with. These are all great plants and great uses for them. I'm going to talk a little bit later about all different options for some of my favorite plants and why they're helpful, but yeah, they provide a really lovely aesthetic thing in your house. It's really soft. They're really lovely and it's a very different shape than most of our furniture nowadays, so they're great.  
  
**Chris:** Nice.  
  
**Hallie:** Plants can also clean the air. To what benefit is questionable and I'll talk about that, but they can also for sure increase the humidity of the space. If you have a dry room, particularly if it's winter time or you live in somewhere like the desert, having plants in your house is definitely going to increase the humidity of the space just because you're watering them more frequently and then there's water in their trays sometimes, and not all the water is going directly into the plants. Having water out is going to be increasing the humidity.  
  
**Chris:** I can definitely see in the winter. July in central Texas, maybe we don't need the humidity quite so much.  
  
**Hallie:** We don't need the humidity here, but I've definitely lived in places where I'm like, oh, it's so nice. I come home, there's a bit of moisture in the air as I'm parched from coming in from the desert sun.  
  
**Chris:** Got it.  
  
**Hallie:** There was a NASA experiment that was published in 1989 that was investigating ways to effectively detoxify space station air and they found that in a lab environment, indoor plants can scrub the air of volatile compounds, like formaldehyde and benzene, which are things that we don't want in our air. However, if you really have a medical need for air purification, don't replace your air purifier, which is plants. Plants are doing this, but not on a huge level. They're very small guys. They can only do so much.  
  
**Chris:** You can't put like a whole rainforest in your bathroom.  
  
**Hallie:** Yeah, I mean, they're lovely to have, but if you need air purification, maybe have both. I don't know. But yeah, they do do this, but on the outside of a laboratory setting, it wasn't a really remarkable difference. I want you to imagine a scenario for me, okay?  
  
**Chris:** All right. I've got my brain camera turned on.  
  
**Hallie:** Okay, so you're sitting in a room. There are no windows.  
  
**Chris:** Why?  
  
**Hallie:** The chair you're sitting in is really hard. It's kind of uncomfortable.  
  
**Chris:** Am I in prison?  
  
**Hallie:** Sure. If you want to be in prison, you can imagine yourself in prison.  
  
**Chris:** I don't want to be in prison. I'm in a really hard chair in a room with no windows. Okay.  
  
**Hallie:** The light overhead is kind of bright. It's like fluorescent. The ground under your feet is like a reflective tile. There's light reflecting back up at you and all the walls are like bright white.  
  
**Chris:** This seriously sounds like the intro to a horror movie.  
  
**\[Laughter\].  
**  
**Hallie:** How do you feel, right?  
  
**Chris:** No, it's awful.  
  
**Hallie:** Not good. Okay. Now imagine the same room, but there's a really big rubber tree plant or ficus plant in the corner of the room. How does that change things?  
  
**Chris:** I guess it creates one point of interest.  
  
**Hallie:** Yeah?  
  
**Chris:** Yeah.  
  
**Hallie:** How do you think your physical reaction would change to that room? Would you feel, I don't know, more stress, less stress, no change?  
  
**Chris:** I would feel less stressed, except if I walked into that room in the first description, I'd be like, oh, this is a really weird cold creepy room. The second description, I'd be like, oh, this is a really weird color, creepy room, but look, there's a plant over there. That's weird. Why did someone put a plant in the corner?  
  
**Hallie:** \[Laughs\]. Sure. It's not a perfect description.  
  
**Chris:** But I see what you're saying. It's the cold creepy room versus the cold creepy room with like a little life in it. Adds as that little something extra.  
  
**Hallie:** There have definitely been studies that have shown that plants in a space can improve your mood, improve your concentration, improve health outcomes. I found this piece from a Psychology Today article that said, "Based on several experimental studies, the presence of potted plants have been found to be helpful in many different settings, including work, school and hospitals. Particularly, they have been shown to lower blood pressure, improve reaction times, increase attentiveness, improve attendance at work and school, raise productivity at work, improve wellbeing, improve perceptions of the space," which is a really vague term.

I don't know how you measure that, but cool. "Lower levels of anxiety when you're recovering from surgery and raise job satisfaction," which is like a lot that we're asking from just these little plants.  
  
**Chris:** No, kidding. I almost feel like this is a superfoods episode and we should put a cape on a houseplant.  
  
**Hallie:** \[Laughs\]. I had a professor in college who is actually studying the impact of plants in a classroom on college quiz test grades and the correlation there. It's great to have plants in a room. They make you feel more relaxed and being inside of an angular stuffy cold room is not natural for our brains. It's not where our brains pick operation. It's weird and so having a little bit of that nature, it seems can help de-stress us and can help us feel more relaxed. Can help us enjoy a space more, which can then I'm assuming correlate to this like improved attendance. If you like the space more, you're probably more likely to go to a space versus if you really hate the space.  
  
**Chris:** Okay, cool. Magic plants.  
  
**Hallie:** I mean, is it magic? Is it brain science? Who can say?  
  
**Chris:** Fair enough, but you know what we can say.  
  
**Hallie:** What's that?  
  
**Chris:** We can say that we're going into a break right now.  
  
**Hallie:** Here we go.  
  
**\[Background music\].**  
  
**Chris:** Hey, Hallie.  
  
**Hallie:** Hey, dad.  
  
**Chris:** Do you know who probably has houseplants?  
  
**Hallie:** Who?  
  
**Chris:** Our starfruit patrons, Vikram, Lindsay, Mama Casey.  
  
**Hallie:** Patrick, and Shianne. You guys are so wonderful and your support means the world to us. If you at home listening are interested in joining our Patreon family, it helps so much. It makes so many things possible for the show, including us to have series, we've got transcripts on the website now, which our patrons are paying for 100%. You have supported so many things about the show and we are so, so grateful. If you are interested in supporting the show, you can head over to patreon.com/onetogrowonpod. We have a lot of different, super fun tiers.  
  
**Chris:** Tiers that get you bonus content like outtakes and little extra audios. We've got the plan of the month club. We send you a little digital file with some plant facts about certain plants and a recipe using that plant and sometimes we'll mail you a postcard, but we haven't recently because I have been a little afraid to go to Office Depot to get a print it out and go to the post office to mail it out. I don't want to do that because there's a plague on, but we will get those mailed out someday. Our starfruit patrons get all kinds of goodies, like boxes of stuff.  
  
**Hallie:** We've been doing like goody boxes for our starfruit patrons. We just did the first one, I guess, back in June. Yeah, June is when they got delivered and we worked with a really cool artist in Australia and she mailed them soaps and handmade candles and handmade lip balms and a bunch of really cool stuff. The next one is going to be closer to November, December. We're doing it about twice a year, so we'll be talking about it again when we get closer to that. But if you're interested in supporting the show at any tiers, any levels, you can do $1, you can do more than that. We would really appreciate the support. If the show is something that's meaningful to you, it's great. We have so much fun over there. You also get a Discord channel and we can chat. Gosh, I feel like this Benadryl is not going well.  
  
**Chris:** It's going super long. Do you know what, I would appreciate if we got back to the episode?  
  
**Hallie:** What's up?  
  
**\[Background music\].**  
  
**Hallie:** Oh my God. Okay. Dad, you got a nature fact for us?  
  
**Chris:** I do have a nature fact.  
  
**Hallie:** Hit me.  
  
**Chris:** All right. In the beginning of the episode, I asked who would want to live in a plant anyway because it's hilarious, right?  
  
**Hallie:** Sure.  
  
**Chris:** Well, you know who does live in plants. It is the Keebler elves. They live in a tree. They do. You know who it turns out is a subsidiary of Keebler?  
  
**Hallie:** Who?  
  
**Chris:** Little Brownie Bakers.  
  
**Hallie:** Okay. \[Laughs\].  
  
**Chris:** They are one of the bakers that make Girl Scout Cookies.  
  
**Hallie:** Yeah, I know this.  
  
**Chris:** For half of the country, Keebler makes Girl Scout Cookies. Not only that, but Keebler has their own cookies that are the same flavors as some of the Girl Scout Cookies, like thin mint and samosas. They're just not as exciting to buy from Keebler as they are from Girl Scout.  
  
**Hallie:** Right.  
  
**Chris:** This blew my mind. Did you already know all this?  
  
**Hallie:** \[Laughs\].  
  
**Chris:** It's not blowing your mind?  
  
**Hallie:** I was a Girl's Scout. I knew this.  
  
**Chris:** What you knew? I feel like you were in on something.  
  
**Hallie:** I was in on something like a conspiracy?  
  
**Chris:** Yeah, you knew the secret.  
  
**Hallie:** We don't have Little Brownie in Texas.

We've got ABC, so it's like a totally different distributor.  
  
**Chris:** Even if I bought the Keebler thin mints, they wouldn't be the same as the Girl Scout thin mints that we get here.  
  
**Hallie:** I mean, it's like the same formula. I don't know how different it is bakery to bakery. I've never done a test comparison.  
  
**Chris:** All right. Well, I don't know. I feel like I'm giving some pretty significant information to the rest of the world so you can be like, yeah, I knew that, whatever, but I bet listener I bet there's at least one of you out there that didn't know that already.  
  
**Hallie:** Congratulations to the rest of our listenership other than me on now finding out that you can buy thin mints all year round, but it does not go to support Girl Scout, which is really great for the development of leadership skills in young women, so sport Girl Scout.  
  
**Chris:** True.  
  
**Hallie:** Oh wait, I have to do the theme.  
  
**Chris:** Oh yeah. You got to do the theme. Don't forget to do the theme.  
  
**Hallie:** Tara-tarara. Nature fact.  
  
**Chris:** Let's say I've gotten really excited about the idea of getting a houseplant after you told me about all this great stuff.  
  
**Hallie:** I hope so.  
  
**Chris:** What do I need to do other than purchase it?  
  
**Hallie:** What do houseplants need?  
  
**Chris:** Yeah, I want to put in the corner of the room that I use for my office.  
  
**Hallie:** Okay. Plants need light and water and carbon dioxide and nitrogen and phosphorus and potassium.  
  
**Chris:** I can definitely supply carbon dioxide.  
  
**Hallie:** Great.  
  
**Chris:** I would probably have to remember to give it water. How often would I need to give it water? I guess it probably depends on the plant.  
  
**Hallie:** Correct.  
  
**Chris:** You say it needs light. Is the light from my overhead enough?  
  
**Hallie:** Probably.  
  
**Chris:** Probably, really?  
  
**Hallie:** But maybe not.  
  
**Chris:** Maybe if there's a window in there, that's a good thing, but maybe the light is good enough, but I have no idea how to get it nitrogen phosphorus or potassium. Do I give it bananas?  
  
**Hallie:** I wouldn't know. Personally, I would not do that at all. If you planted in potting soil, it has a lot of nutrients in it. If you plant it with compost, then that improves the nutrition as well, but also you will probably want to have some kind of liquid fertilizer. Eventually, it will need it. There are different options. There are mineral versions, there are organic versions. You can just go to your local nursery and say, "Hey, I have this plant. What do you recommend?" They have a myriad of options. You can buy it at a large hardware store, like a big box, but I always recommend shopping local because they typically have a wider selection and they will also have great knowledge on what would do best for your houseplants.  
  
  

**Chris:** Wait, if I have say a slightly bigger houseplant that I have to put on the floor, maybe it's a ficus or something that takes up a large area of a pot, can I put my composting material directly on top of that and just have it compost on top of the plant soil and then sort of mix it in over time?  
  
**Hallie:** Yeah, you can top dress with compost.  
  
**Chris:** Really?  
  
**Hallie:** But you can also just mix it in when you're potting it up, if you'd like, and that typically helps the bacteria and the fungi and whatever else is living in your compost to just disperse. I mean, they're very small little guys. If you put them on the top, it's going to take them a long time to get down to the bottom. If you mix them in your own self, then it just helps them get around to all the different parts of your plant. But if your pot is already planted, you don't want to repot it. You can totally just top dress with compost.  
  
**Chris:** Okay. That makes sense.  
  
**Hallie:** I wanted to talk about some of my favorite plants and specifically outlining what they need, what they're good for and then after that I was going to talk about some of the common issues and some of the best practices for having houseplants.  
  
**Chris:** Lay it on me.  
  
**Hallie:** Number one, pothos ivy, you know this plant. It's what your houseplant, Gary was. It doesn't need full sun. Very expressive. They really let you know when something's going on. Not all plants do that. Really easy to propagate, easy to grow and water. They're great.  
  
**Chris:** Actually, it's Jerry.  
  
**Hallie:** Okay. Sorry, Larry.  
  
**Chris: \[**Laughs\]. Actually, it's Jerry.  
  
**Hallie:** Terry, got it.  
  
**\[Laughter\].  
**  
**Chris:** But I feel like I'm cutting you off a little bit here. I feel like there was a point where the little jar of water that I was growing him in wasn't good enough anymore and I needed to do something else with them, like move them to a different container or to some dirt or something. Does that make sense? Should I have done something with them?  
  
**Hallie:** Yeah, pothus ivy can grow 100% hydroponically. Austin has hardish water, so usually there's a good amount of nutrition in the water itself.

But if you want the plant to continue creating new leaves, and growing as opposed to just growing small amounts and then shedding the old leaves, so really increasing the amount of leaves and the size of the plant, then you probably will have to add additional nutrition into the water just so that it can fill all themselves up.  
  
**Chris:** But you don't move it to a bigger container or anything like that. I don't know.  
  
**Hallie:** You might eventually need to do that just based on gravity, mostly like physics if physics-lly it's not holding up, but you can have a tall plant with a small root ball in a small container, but you just have to make sure that it's getting the nutrition and the water it needs without burning it. If you had a lot of leaves in a small root area, you would have to water it probably more frequently with the low dilution because otherwise it wouldn't be getting enough nutrition and you could have the potential of burning the leaves if you added more nutrition. Increase the dilution of it. Does that make sense?  
  
**Chris:** Yes.  
  
**Hallie:** Cool. Next, Rosemary. Rosemary does need full sun, so you got to have one of the big windows for it, but it does not need a lot of water. Also, smells very nice and it will flower and you can also eat it, which is a bonus.  
  
**Chris:** It goes great on chicken.  
  
**Hallie:** Three, piece lily. I was informed one time by someone who worked at a florist shop that this is a plant that you get people when they know someone who has died. It's like a condolence plant, but it's not just that, but just so you know, they might make a comment when you try and buy it. It does not need direct sun. It's one of the best plants for low light. It's a really, really good office plant because it's nice and big, but it grows really slowly and it doesn't get super tall. It's super manageable and it has nice flowers.  
  
**Chris:** Flowers are great. Love a flower.  
  
**Hallie:** Number four is the bromeliad. The flowers on this one have super nice color depending on what you get. You can get a pink, a yellow, an orange or red. They do need high drainage and they can tolerate high sun, but they're super lovely. The fifth one is a dieffenbachia. These are good for small plants, but they can also get really big, which is super nice. They do need good drainage, but they're also super good for low light.  
  
**Chris:** Cool. Lots of options.  
  
**Hallie:** Those are my faves. There's a billion gillion houseplants, so you don't have to get one of these. Please send us pictures of your house plants on Twitter, even if they're not one of these six plants, but especially if they are, please send pictures.  
  
**Chris:** Five plants. You talked about five plants.  
  
**Hallie:** One, two, three, four, five. I talked about five plants.  
  
**Chris:** \[Laughs\].  
  
**Hallie:** Next, I was going to talk about some of the common issues. With houseplants, you can get some pest problems. Some of the most common pests are white fly, spider mites, scale. The most common time to get pest for your houseplant is when you buy a new plant and it's already infected. You can have one of your existing plants get infected with a pest, but it's just not as likely because the pest has to be introduced somehow and it's your house, so you're usually not bringing spider mites in to your own house other than on a plant. When you buy a plant, this is another reason to be really critical. When buying your plants, thinking through where you're buying it from, do you trust them? Are you sure it's clean? Inspecting plants before you bring them home. I oftentimes if I buy a new plant, I'll keep it away from my older plants, like my existing plants in the house, just to make sure I don't see any symptoms or issues before introducing it to the rest of the house.  
  
**Chris:** Do they follow you home?  
  
**Hallie:** Wait, what do you mean?  
  
**Chris:** Spider mites. Like maybe you're walking home from work and the spider might say, "Oh, I bet he has a nice houseplant."  
  
**Hallie:** \[Laughs\]. Probably not. If you get an infestation in your plants just start by pinching off as many of the insects as you see. That might be able to curb the infestation before it really takes off. But if it kind of takes off, you want to separate the infested plants from those that are not infested and you just have to research treatment methods based on what the infestation is. It depends based on pest. Sorry, I can't give more specific advice.  
  
**Chris:** I was going to say if the pest is new to you, you probably have to research what even the pest is before you research the treatment method.  
  
**Hallie:** Yeah, unfortunately. Other issues you can get disease. Typically, it's a fungus. Sometimes it's a bacteria that will affect a houseplant. Similar to a pest the most frequent time to get this is with a new plant. Similar to pest, you'll want to cordon off the infected plant. There are several common diseases that can plaque houseplants. One of them is powdery mildew, which can really easily be treated by spraying a solution of water and baking soda onto the leaves of the plant. If you get a fungus in your potting soil, you just have to replant the plant in brand new soil, toss out the old stuff. But also if you see mushrooms in your houseplants, don't worry about it. It's probably just compost mycelia that is now fruiting, so it's fine.  
  
**Chris:** Are they talking to the plant?  
  
**Hallie:** Yeah, they're probably talking to the plant. It's great to have fungi in your soil, but if it's like a fungal infection, if it's causing issues, then repot just shake off as much of the soil from the roots as you can. Try to get it really clean and then repot.  
  
**Chris:** All right.  
  
**Hallie:** If your plant is wilting, yellowing, showing general signs of poor health, then it could be being watered incorrectly. Both over-watering and underwater can show similar stress signs, which can be frustrating. However, you probably know how much you're watering it. If you think you're watering it too much, water it less. If you think you're not watering enough, then water it more. Both cases of over and under watering, it's because the roots aren't functioning properly. They're not able to take up water. If you're under watering it, then the water is just not there, so the roots begin to die off and they're not able to take that water up, but if you're over-watering it, then the roots become anaerobic. They don't have enough oxygen and so the roots begin to die off and they can't take up water. That's why it looks similar, but usually if your roots are becoming anaerobic, it's being overwatered, then you can just feel the soil. If it's still wet, then it just really needs to dry off. You might need to pull your plant out and repot it, but usually just changing the watering regime is good enough. You can't also have incorrect light. If your plant is yellowing, it's not getting enough sun. If it's being scorched, if it looks like it's being burned, like there's brown spots on the leaves, then it might be getting too much sun. That's the run through of issues. Some of the best practices to avoid these issues, always consider your environment when deciding which plant to get. We talked about this in the vegetable gardening episode as well. Don't get a full sun plant if you're planning on putting it under a fluorescent light. Don't get a partial sun plant and put it next to a window, it will get scorched. Consider how often you want to be watering your plants. Think about your own preferences with how you want to be interacting with your plants. Always plant it correctly.

You want to make sure that your root ball is higher up in the pot. This is one of the main mistakes that I see people make. With houseplants is they plant the root ball too low and then it's hard to get oxygen into the root ball zone. Make sure it's planted nice and high up in the pot.  
  
**Chris:** The root ball, I guess is just the roots of the plant and if it's too low, it can't get oxygen. Which sounds weird. I don't understand why that is.  
  
**Hallie:** Well, I mean, we've talked about soil in the past. Potting soil is different from ground soil obviously, but potting soil still has a lot of oxygen in the roots. The soil in the ground is like 50% pore space, usually. Potting soil usually has a little bit more than that, but our plants are used to growing in soil in the ground and so they need that pore space. Usually, it'll get filled up with water and then the water will drain quickly and then it will get filled up with air again. If you don't have air in your root zone, then you get, like I was talking about earlier, you can get anaerobic conditions with your roots.  
  
**Chris:** Got it.  
  
**Hallie:** If they're not getting enough water, then the roots can begin to rot. You can begin to have fungal issues. You need to have some air movement, which does not seem intuitive it's true, but it's still important for good plant health. The exception is if you're growing something hydroponically, obviously it's already anaerobic, but it's a different situation. Make sure you're always using high quality compost and/or a good potting soil or core or whatever you're using.

If you're planting in a jar or a mug or a cup or something without drainage, you can do that, but you will need to repot the plant regularly at least once a year. If you plant it in a pot, you might start to see like a white crust appear on the top of your potting soil. That's salts building up from your tap water. Tap water is not purified. If you water your plants with like 100% purified bottled water, then you won't see that, but it's a waste. It's fine. It's not hurting the plant, but it can become unsightly. It can be a good practice to repot once in a while after you start to see that salt buildup.  
  
**Chris:** You keep talking about repotting, is this like an as needed thing or should you report periodically? You were talking about, I guess the mugs and cups and jar plants repot at least once a year as a good guideline.  
  
**Hallie:** Other than that it's as needed. Honestly, you could have plants in the same pot for decades and they can do fine. One trick if you're dealing with bigger plants, it can be easier to leave them in like the plastic pots that you get at the store just because if you need to repot them, you can really easily cut those pots out. If you just take that flimsy plastic pot and put it whole hog into like a nicer looking planter, but not actually replant it into the planter. Those planters can be super heavy. If a bigger plant needs to be repotted and it's like planted into the planter, it can just be a real pain to get that done. That's one of the main issues I think with repotting is if they're really big, so it might just be easier do that, but yeah, other than that, it's just as needed. There's not always a regime. Some plants need more maintenance in repotting, but it's got to be like a plant by plant rule. There's not kind of a rule of thumb that you can go by.  
  
**Chris:** Not even a green thumb.  
  
**Hallie:** Not even a rule of green rule of thumb.  
  
**Chris:** Green rule of thumb.  
  
**Hallie:** \[Laughs\]. That's pretty much it for tropical houseplants. I also included a little bit at the end. If you want to be doing like food crops indoors, pretty much always, they will need a lot more light so you can buy grow lights. You can just use any fluorescent or led bulb and usually it says like how many lumens they are, and there's really helpful resources online for knowing how bright you want a light to be a grow light. I would opt for led if you're between fluorescent led, because fluorescents can get really hot, which unless you're growing something like, I don't know, peppers or tomatoes or something that you probably won't want, especially if your plants are growing up and they might end up touching the bulbs, that can be really damaging to the leaves if they end up touching like a hot fluorescent bulb, but yeah, you can grow whatever you want inside. Why not?  
  
**Chris:** All right. So grow something. There's some maintenance, but it sounds pretty easy and it'll make you a happier, better person in the end.  
  
**Hallie:** Yeah.
