In the second week of our agricultural exchange, we’re bringing you Native Farmers in New Mexico from Toasted Sister. Host Andi Murphy interviews Native farmers Nicholas Ashley, Shannon James and James Skeet, as well as cultural education specialist Bettina Sandoval and Fruit and Vegetable Perscription Program coordinator Akeemi Martinez about the history, cultural significance and future of Navajo and Pueblo agriculture in New Mexico. Andi and her guests also cover how to improve soil health in backyard gardens to grow your own food.
