Does biodiesel dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions? Does it do more harm than good? Does it make exhaust smell like french fries? Hallie and Chris discuss all these questions and more in this week's episode. We learn the complex history of biodiesel (full of really cool names) as well as how it's used today, and how it might be used in the future.
