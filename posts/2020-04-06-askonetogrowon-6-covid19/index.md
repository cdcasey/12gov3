On this maxisode-length edition of Ask One to Grow On, three-quarters of the Casey family (Hallie, Chris and Joanna) discuss how the COVID19 outbreak is impacting agriculture and the food supply chain.

A quick note: Hallie says that the virus can only live for 3-4 hours on inanimate objects. The correct number is up to 3 days, depending on the surface.
