This week we're changing it up! Hallie and Catherine discuss what makes something a fruit, vegetable or both, as well how these categories came to be, and what to do if you have a campfire during a burn ban. If you've ever been unsure on exactly counts as what, or who gets to make these decisions, this is the episode for you!
