This week we’re digging into all things small, skinny and wiggly: worms. Hallie and Chris discuss worms, what they are, why they’re so important and their appearance in sci-fi movies. We learn how worms help the soil, how to keep them, and how to use them to fish.

A quick note: Hallie misspoke in this episode, nematodes are not annelids
