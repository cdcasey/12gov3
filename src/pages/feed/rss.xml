		<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, friends, this is it. After much discussion, we&#039;ve decided to step away from the podcast for the foreseeable future. But instead of just podfading, we thought we&#039;d put out one last episode answering some of the most commonly googled agricuture-related questions. Thank you so much for everything over the past few years. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;In the last week of our agriculture exchange, we&#039;re bringing you an episode from Sourceress. Hosts Colleen King and Carolyn Kissick interview Sims McCormick and Rob Knecht, the founders of Real Oyster Cult. They discuss the history of oyster consumption, the current oyster consumption culture, and how these mollusks can help stop climate change. Like all Sourceress episodes, this one ends with an analysis of music from the food&#039;s source areas. In this case, that means the American Folk Revival. &lt;/p&gt;
